==============
? Lambda for REST
  X Entire rest app as an AWS lambda
  X Individual routes as individual lambdas
  X API Gateway configuration
  ? Auto deployment of application
  X CLI entry point to facilitate

? SQL - as a doc store, limited functionality
  ? Model support for SQL databases
  ? Might need to be a whole new set of sql operations
  X Using Sequelize?
  X Already supports most of the needed features, might be an easy win
