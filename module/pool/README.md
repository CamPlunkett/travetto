travetto: Pool
===
This module provides an API for dealing with pools of elements, and special attention is given to pools that are used for managing jobs as opposed to simple resources.

The module wraps around [`generic-pool`](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool) as a base for the pooling mechanism.
